### Error Handling

Errors in this API are typically returned with a specific status code and an object containing details about the error.

**Status Code:** `400 Bad Request`

This status code indicates that the server could not process the request due to missing or invalid data.

### Workflow

1. **Transaction Validation**:
   - The input data is validated to ensure all required fields are provided and in the correct format.
   
2. **Transaction Processing**:
   - Based on the input and random outcomes, the transaction is processed, including cashback redemption and cash payment.
   
3. **Response Formation**:
   - The outcome of the transaction (success, insufficient funds, payment failure) is returned in a structured response.

### Important Notes

- Ensure all required fields are included in the request body, as missing or incorrect fields will result in validation errors.
- The server randomly simulates different transaction outcomes.
