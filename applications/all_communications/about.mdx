# Communication Module

## Overview

The Communication Module is designed to handle critical communication tasks related to user authentication, specifically focusing on email verification during sign-up and two-factor authentication (2FA). This module ensures that all emails sent for verification purposes, such as sign-up confirmations and OTP (One-Time Password) for 2FA, are handled securely and efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Email Verification:** Ensures that users' email addresses are unique and verified before they can fully register on the platform. This is crucial for platforms like Dwolla, which require unique email addresses for users.
  
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Provides an additional layer of security by sending OTPs to users' verified email addresses, ensuring that only the intended user can access their account.

- **Temporary Email Handling:** Manages the temporary storage of email addresses and OTPs, validating user input before confirmation.

- **Integration with Dwolla:** Ensures compliance with Dwolla's requirement for unique and verified email addresses, facilitating a smooth user onboarding process.

This module is a vital component of the system, ensuring that all user authentication processes involving email are handled with the highest level of security and reliability.
