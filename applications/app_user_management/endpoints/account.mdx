### Error Handling

Errors in this API are typically returned with a specific status code and an object containing details about the error.

**Status Code:** `400 Bad Request`

This status code indicates that the server could not process the request due to a client error, such as a validation failure.

#### Example: Username Already Exists

This error occurs when the provided username is already associated with an existing account.

| **Field**       | **Type** | **Description**                                                     |

| `error.username`| String   | A descriptive message indicating that "Username already exists".    |

### Workflow

1. **Email Verification**: 
   - The `profile_pk` is used to verify if the email associated with the profile has been verified.
   
2. **User Registration**:
   - The `SignUpSerializer` validates and creates the new user account.
   - The username and email are checked for uniqueness. If a conflict is found, an appropriate error is raised.
   
3. **Account Creation**:
   - After successfully creating the user account, additional setup may include linking with external services.
   
4. **Token Generation**:
   - Upon successful account creation, an authentication token is generated and returned in the response.

### Important Notes

- Ensure that the profile associated with `profile_pk` is verified before making this request.
- The password should be strong and meet the application's security requirements.
