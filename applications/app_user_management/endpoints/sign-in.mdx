### Error Handling

Errors in this API are typically returned with a specific status code and an object containing details about the error.

**Status Code:** `400 Bad Request`

This status code indicates that the server could not process the request due to a client error, such as incorrect credentials.

#### Example: Invalid Username or Password

This error occurs when the provided username or password is incorrect.

| **Field**   | **Type** | **Description**                                               |
|-------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `username`  | String   | An empty string is returned to indicate an issue with the username. |
| `password`  | String   | A message indicating "Incorrect username and password" is returned. |

### Workflow

1. **Credential Validation**:
   - The provided username and password are checked against the stored credentials.
   - If the credentials are valid, the user is authenticated.
   
2. **Token Generation**:
   - Upon successful sign-in, an authentication token is generated and returned in the response.
   
3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the username or password is invalid, an error is returned with a message indicating the issue.

### Important Notes

- Ensure that the username and password provided match the user's registered credentials.
- For security reasons, it is important to handle errors in a way that does not reveal which part of the credentials was incorrect.
