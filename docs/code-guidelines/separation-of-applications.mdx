In our Django project, we maintain a monolithic architecture while ensuring clear separation of 
applications to avoid direct dependencies between them. Each app is designed to function as a 
standalone module, managing its own models, views, and business logic independently. 
This ensures modularity and scalability while minimizing the risk of overlapping or tightly coupled code.

## Application Isolation

Each app serves a distinct purpose and is isolated to prevent any direct interaction with other apps. 
For instance, an app responsible for handling transactions should not directly interact with models 
from the merchant or consumer apps, aside from shared models like User or MerchantUser. 
This separation is strictly enforced to ensure that each app can evolve independently without affecting others.

## Shared Models and User Connections

The only overlap between apps is through shared models, such as User or MerchantUser. 
These models are centrally managed and referenced by multiple apps to ensure consistency 
across the system. For example, a transaction might reference a User or MerchantUser, 
but no other models should be directly connected across apps.

## Service Providers and Model Data Providers

Inter-app communication is managed through service providers or model data providers. 
These providers act as intermediaries, ensuring that any data needed by one app from 
another is accessed through clearly defined service layers. This design ensures that 
no app directly manipulates or depends on another app's internal models or business logic, 
further reinforcing the principle of isolation.
Developers should refer to the relevant service provider documentation and shared 
model references to understand how one app communicates with another while maintaining separation.
This structure ensures that our project remains modular, scalable, and maintainable, 
while allowing apps to interact only when absolutely necessary through well-defined channels.
